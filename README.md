# How to install

- download this zip archive: https://github.com/Sempione/pspip/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
- unzip the archive and move the resulting directory into the QGIS plugins directory
 (on Windows usually "C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins" replace "USER" by the actual user name)
- search for "Put spaced points in polygons" in the QGIS plugin manager and install it
- the plugin is now in the QGIS processing toolbox (section: "User-created")
